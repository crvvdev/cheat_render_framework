# cheat_render_framework
 
## This is a project of mine which can be used as a simple lightweight renderer for small projects (mainly game hacking related).
It supports basic primitive shapes (lines, rectangles, circles) and has a font support as well.

It's a single header file style, so to make use of it simply include the desired render factory and start using it.

Currently it's only supported for the following render APIs:

* DirectX 9
* DirectX 11

## Showcase

*DirectX11*
